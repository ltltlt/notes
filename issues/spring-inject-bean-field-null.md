I have a bean, I write some logic in the constructor, 
this constructor use @Value annotation to inject some value into constructor,
and constructor initialize a variable to be used,
this bean have repository annotation, so naturally it will be created and managed
by spring,
I use spring Autowired to inject it into some other bean,
then I found out that the constructor called, but the bean injected have the wrong field(all null), this bean's type is ...Enhancer..Spring.., obvious, this
class is generated by spring CGLib, and is subclass of my bean type.

It's easy to understand why this bean is subclassed(because the repository annotation so spring will subclass it and have some extra logic to wrap some exception), it's not easy to understand why my constructor is not be called by this subclassed bean.(Maybe I will post it on stackoverflow)

Here is how I solve it: I create a interface to let my bean implement it, so spring will not use CGLib to generate proxy(subclass), rather, it will use java proxy mechanism to proxy this class, so my constructor will be called.
